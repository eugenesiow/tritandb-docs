# Building Extensions for TritanDB

TritanDB allows extensions by exposing interfaces. Developers can access and build extensions for TritanDB in Kotlin or Java (or any JVM language) based on these interfaces.

Developers might want to extend TritanDB to support various graph or tree models within the model tier or various matching engines for the match step. The operate step on the database and model tier is also customisable.
